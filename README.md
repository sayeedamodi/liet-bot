```

#### 4. Set up MongoDB:
LIET Bot uses MongoDB to store conversation context. To set it up:
- **Install MongoDB**: Follow the [MongoDB installation guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).
- **Run MongoDB**:
  ```bash
  mongod
  ```

#### 5. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/liet-bot
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```
- Replace `your-openai-api-key` with your own OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo API key. You can get it from the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

#### 6. Run the server:
Start the backend server by running:
```bash
python app.py
```

Access the bot at `localhost:5000` in your browser.

### üìù `system_content.txt` File for Context Storage
The `LIET Bot` stores the conversation context in the `system_content.txt` file. This file helps maintain continuity in interactions by storing user inputs and the bot‚Äôs responses.

- **Location**: `/system_content.txt`
- **Purpose**: Tracks important data like previous queries, answers, and context for ongoing conversations.
